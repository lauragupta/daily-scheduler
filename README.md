# daily-scheduler

This project had a big focus on using Moment.js to use times appropriately in functions. JQuery was new to me but I was able to utilize it in a lot of my code. This project also utalized Bootstrap for some of the CSS and layout.  I wrote lots of functions and did a lot of work with local storage to be able to save information in an object to pull it back onto the page and use again.
